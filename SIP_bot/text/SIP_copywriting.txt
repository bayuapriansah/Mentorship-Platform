For Students Page
This platform offers students the opportunity to work on AI projects in an online work-like environment. Unlike typical projects or tutorials that provide a step-by-step guide, this platform is designed to replicate real-world work settings, allowing students to tackle projects with increasing independence. By completing the projects on this platform, students will develop valuable skills in problem-solving, time management, and accountability as they take ownership of their tasks and meet deadlines.
The AI projects featured on this platform have been thoughtfully crafted to guide students through a work-like project experience, enhancing their independence and preparing them for industry settings. Students will gain experience in data collection, data wrangling, data pipelining, AI model building, AI model evaluation, and soon, AI solution proof of concept deployment.
Throughout their time on the platform, students will enroll in projects, receive tasks, complete work, and submit it for review. Feedback will be provided, allowing students to revise and improve their work. Successful completion of the simulated internship program will result in a portfolio of projects that not only showcases a student's growth as a developer but also demonstrates their ability to work independently in a work-like setting.
Overall, the platform provides students with a unique opportunity to develop practical skills, collaborate with industry professionals, and gain valuable experience that will benefit them in their future careers.

Submit the task
Move onto the next task
Previous task will either be approved or ask for revision with feedback
If revisions are necessary students will need to return to the previous task and get it approved in order to complete the entire project

For Insitutes Page
In today's competitive job market, academic credentials alone are no longer enough to secure employment. Practical experience and relevant skills are increasingly in demand by employers. The simulated internship platform offers students the opportunity to work on AI projects and gain practical experience to help them stand out in the job market.
Joining our platform can benefit your institution and students in several ways. Firstly, students will have a practical learning experience that simulates the demands of the workforce. This enables them to apply the knowledge and skills they have acquired in the classroom to real-world scenarios, developing critical skills that employers look for in candidates.

Secondly, the online format offers flexibility and convenience. Students can access the program at their own pace and from anywhere. This makes it possible for students who may be unable to participate in traditional internships to still benefit from the program. Additionally, students can manage their schedules and balance personal commitments with meeting project deadlines.

Thirdly, our program provides exposure to different types of AI projects, allowing students to build a well-rounded portfolio and explore various career paths. Students can select projects based on their interests and gain a better understanding of which paths they wish to pursue and specialize in.
Lastly, our online simulated internship programs offer a safe learning environment where students can learn and experiment without fear of consequences. This allows students to develop their skills and confidence without any pressure.

This means that students will turn to you for guidance and support as they work on the projects.
By partnering with our platform, educational institutions can help their students bridge the gap between the classroom and the workforce, gain a competitive edge in the job market, and make informed career choices. Join us today and help your students achieve their career goals!

For Partners Page
Collaborating with a platform that connects students with real-world problems presents an excellent opportunity for companies to receive innovative insights and potential solutions to their most pressing challenges. By sharing problem statements and anonymized data with our team, partners can benefit from the innovative thinking of a talented and motivated pool of students.
Students participating in the program are keen to work on real-world projects that can help them build their skills and gain practical experience, making it a mutually beneficial program for both partners and students.
Moreover, partnering with the platform can help companies identify potential future talent. The program provides a unique opportunity for partners to engage with students who have demonstrated an interest in their industry and challenges, enabling them to evaluate their skills, work ethic, and suitability for future employment opportunities.
The platform takes privacy and data security seriously, and all data provided by partners is anonymized to protect confidentiality. Partners can be confident that their sensitive data will be safeguarded throughout the program, and they will have control over how and when their data is shared with students.
In designing a project, we are here to support you and ensure that both you and the students have a positive experience. Our AI educators will take your proposed project and transform it into the final project the students will see. Once the project is live, you will have the opportunity to interact with the students as if you are their customer contracting them to work on your project. However, this is optional as our team will also be there to help the students complete the project.

To get involved, please contact us to start discussing your problem statements, and we will begin transforming them into a project for our students. By collaborating with our platform, you can tap into the talent and creativity of motivated students from diverse backgrounds, gain fresh insights and potential solutions to your challenges, and help shape the minds and careers of future leaders. Contact us now to start the conversation and see how we can help turn your problem statement into a real-world project.
