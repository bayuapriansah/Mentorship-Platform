0,CryptoGuides ProjectDetails,"CryptoGuides ProjectDetails. Crypto Guides Our new customer, Crypto Guides, is a crypto startup that is focused on creating interactive learning tools for educating people about crypto currencies and blockchain technologies. Their plan for the future is to merge their educational content with a live exchange but as of right now they are focused on the educational side and just reference other websites for their coin prices. A chapter of their next course is comparing the stocks and other assets to crypto currencies and discussing different trends in crypto prices. To assist this chapter the CTO, Anip Sharma, wants the development team to use AI to make a price prediction model for crypto currencies to be included in the section on trading with bots. However, their development team has little experience with AI and is also mainly focused on their work with developing their exchange. Therefore, they have commissioned us to provide someone who is an AI expert to setup their data pipeline for current crypto prices and create the model for predicting the price of crypto coins . Injection Card 1 Card Title (i.e., email subject): Data Source Identification Hello, Welcome to the team, we are excited to be working with you. I assume your manager has already briefed you on the project so let’s get right into it. In our other content we reference a lot of other cryptocurrency websites and exchanges but we do not pull actual data. Since we’re obviously going to need actual data to train a model, could you investigate which is the best website for us to use to get our data from? There are many sites that have their own APIs or you could use web scraping to pull the information down, there are also sites like Yahoo that let you download the data directly, but it only has daily open and closing price data. In any case, we need you to find a data source that can give us the following: Data of coin prices in USD Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin are the main ones we’ve been referencing so it has to have those 3 Data is updated at a minimum daily Ideally we’d like also to have a weekly, daily, and hourly breakdown in the data To begin searching we’d recommend looking into the following sites: https://finance.yahoo.com https://coinmarketcap.com/ https://www.binance.com/ https://www.coinbase.com/ There’s even a coinbase API client library in python https://pypi.org/project/coinbase/ Please conduct your research and in a google colab notebook submit a text field(s) outlining your findings and recommendation on which method you plan to use for this project. You can also include any coding cells you think necessary to show how you intend to get the data or to highlight the issues you’ve encountered with the other sources to support why we don’t get data from them. Injection Card 2 Card Title (i.e., email subject): Data Collection Hello, Now that you’ve identified what you think is the best approach for data collection, let’s collect data! As our primary goal of this project is to predict the cryptocurrency price trends for the future, we’ll need a dataset of past data to train our model on. Using your data collection strategy, you have to create datasets for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. In addition to the dataset, we’d like you to submit a google colab notebook swith explanations outlining: What are the features you are going to be using from the collected data? If you have to remove features, how did you decide on which to keep and which to discard? Since it is time series data, there must be a timestamp present. Is it in UNIX? If it is in UNIX, how do you plan to convert it to human-readable date time? Are there any missing values present? If yes, what is the imputation technique you are following? Why did you choose that technique? Injection Card 3 Card Title (i.e., email subject): Data Pipeline (Bitcoin) Hello, Great job creating our training dataset. Now before we can move forward with building a model, we absolutely need this model to be able to make predictions on live data so that our readers can actively see how effective it is to use AI for trading. Can you create a data pipeline that will take data from the data source and process it to be usable for training on demand? We’ll need to do this because obviously if I want to just update my dataset I need to keep that pipeline separate from any code relating to the model. Therefore, we will need a function to update our master dataset with all data from our last update. I.e., if I only have data up to January 1st, 2023 then the next time I update the dataset it will collect all data from January 1st, 2023 to today and save it in the master dataset. But, I do not want to need to update my entire dataset to check my models predictions to the current price. Therefore, in addition to the dataset update function, you will need to make a function to get, clean, and present the price for a specific date. Injection Card 4 Card Title (i.e., email subject): Model Building - Price Prediction Hello, Fantastic! Thanks to you, for building the data pipeline. As we review your work, we’d like you to move onto creating the price prediction model! To keep things simple for our team, we think it would be best for you to just focus on predicting the price of Bitcoin for now. As we are not that experienced on the AI front we’d like you to create and compare three different AI models that use 3 different algorithms for Bitcoin price prediction. We will leave it to you to decide on what algorithms to choose but, we’d like an explanation of each and why each of them are viable options for price prediction. Then of course, we will require you to compare their performance and make a recommendation on which model we should include in our main product. To summarise, we’d like you to submit a google colab notebook with: 3 sections dedicated to each individual model that will include: Algorithm identification and explanation Training Evaluation Report Then the final model recommendation with references to the evaluation reports Injection Card 5w Card Title (i.e., email subject): Data Pipeline (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin) Hello, Excellent, great work on the Bitcoin model. We are reviewing your work right now, so in the meantime we’d like you to move on to incorporating Ethereum and Litecoin into the model. To do this we’re going to first need to set up the data pipeline for Ethereum and Litecoin. To keep things organised we’d like you to keep the datasets for Ethereum and Litecoin separate. Please create a data pipeline for both Etereum and Litecoin just like you do for Bitcoin but keep them all in the same jupyter notebook. Therefore, we’re expecting you to submit a google colab notebook with the Bitcoin pipeline and then build one pipeline for Ethereum and one for Litecoin, so all three coins have the same two functions (dataset update and exact date price retrieval). Injection Card 6 Card Title (i.e., email subject): Model Building for Multiple Coin Prediction Hello, Wonderful, as we review your code we’d like you to create a model that can predict the price of any of our three coins. Before your model only predicted the price of Bitcoin and was only trained on bitcoin data. Now we want to see how well one single model can do on predicting the price of the three coins. Please build three different multi coin price prediction models with the same algorithms you used in the Bitcoin model building task. Then, we will need you to again compare their performance and make a recommendation on which model we should include in our main product. But in addition to that we’d like you to test on 5 different test datasets. Bitcoin only Ethereum only Litecoin only All coins (with an equal number of each coin) All coins (with a random selection of each coin) As a final step, we’d like you to explain any trends or relationships you observe between your results across these 5 datasets. To summarize, we’d like you to submit a google colab notebook with: 3 sections dedicated to each individual model that will include: Algorithm identification and explanation Training Evaluation report that includes model evaluations on the 5 different datasets Explaination for the evaluation results on the 5 different datasets Then the final model recommendation with references to the evaluation reports Injection Card 7 Card Title (i.e., email subject): Building a Basic Crypto Trading Bot Hello, Next step is to build your own trading bot and run live simulations. To do this, you need to know the following: What exchanges do we want to pull data from? (eg. Binance API) What additional tools or libraries will we use to perform this task? What metrics do we want to capture to automate cryptocurrency trading? Some popular technical indicators are SMA(Simple Moving Average), RSI(Relative Strength Index) and MACD(Moving Average Convergence/Divergence) Indicator. How will you set up the algorithm to determine whether to buy, sell or hold? Please note: This should be considered as a programming project assignment only. Not intended for any kind of investment advice. Kindly use your own discretion for financial decisions. Injection Card 8 Card Title (i.e., email subject): Deployment in Streamlit Hello, Now we have reached the final stage of the project, deployment. Deployment is crucial in AIprojects because it is the process of putting the model into production, where it can be accessed and used by end-users or integrated into other systems.Without deployment, the model remains only a theoretical concept, and its value is limited. Develop a Streamlit app that incorporates a machine learning model created in task 6 for price prediction of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, and the trading bot that uses these predictions to make buy/sell decisions. The app should allow users to input data and generate predictions, as well as view the trading bot's decisions and performance. Additionally, the deployment should be tested and optimized for stability and performance. Also conduct a research on other free deployment platforms available for machine learning models and provide a google document link with all your findings. Additionally, can you suggest any other platforms that you believe may be suitable for the deployment of price prediction of cryptocurrencies, in addition to Streamlit? "
1,eAuto ProjectDetails,"eAuto ProjectDetails. eAuto Problem Statement Project Details: Electric Automobiles Limited is a small company with an auto shop, mechanic, gas station, and carwash all on-site. Their vision is to be a one-stop shop for all vehicle needs. They have automated as much as possible to balance the demands of offering so many services. Next, they want to use AI to make their company even more efficient. Their issue is that they do not know enough about AI yet. The customer service manager, Vaibhav, is the most interested in AI. As the company’s first POC project, he wants to use CV to collect customer demographic information at the automated car wash. The carwash is fully automated, so customers only have to drive up, select the type of carwash, pay with their card, and drive in. Vaibhav has chosen this as eAuto’s first project because he wants to collect customer information from the carwash to determine who is using that service and see if eAuto could draw the customers who only use it into their auto shop. He thinks this is a good place to start because once cars start to enter the carwash, it will be easy to identify the brand of the car and have a clear shot of the customer’s face. They do not have their cameras set up at the carwash yet, so the dataset for the POC was made via web scraping. The dataset is photos of the front of India’s 9 most common car brands (Volkswagen, Honda, Suzuki, Hyundai, Tata, Toyota, Ford, Renault, and Nissan). Although web scraping is very helpful, it does mean the dataset has a lot of variance. They are looking for talented AI engineers to help them build this product! Project Proposal Summary: eAuto is requesting assistance creating a computer vision model to collect customer demographic information at their car wash. This project requires dataset creation/expansion and model building. There will be a camera mounted at the front of the carwash to collect either video or photos as cars enter the carwash. eAuto wants to try to identify/collect the following: The brand (i.e., the logo) of the customer’s car. The customer’s age, race, and gender. They are open to discussing other information that can potentially be collected. The collected information will be used to identify the demographic disproportionately using the carwash only so that eAuto can target this demographic to attract them into using their other services (specifically their auto shop). The car information will then be used to identify what products to offer in the auto shop.  Brief Project Overview (for project cards): Build a CV model for eAuto to collect customer demographic information from their carwash. In this project, you will need to create/expand on their dataset, label new data, and train a model. Injection Card 1 Card Title (i.e., email subject): Dataset Evaluation Hello, I am Vaibhav, and I look forward to working on this project with you. I assume your manager has briefed you on the project, so I won’t spend time reviewing the details. But I just wanted to let you know that you can always message me if you have any questions about the project, and either myself or my team will get back to you! We at eAuto are new to AI and are looking to you to help us complete the project, but we also want you to help us learn more about AI and how we can use it now and in the future. Therefore, if you have any ideas or concerns about the project, please feel free to bring them up. Now to business. All we have done so far is create a dataset we’ve put together by web scraping for you to get started with. So, the first thing we’d like you to do is review the dataset and write a Colab notebook that has both code and explanations to address the following: 1. We scraped the web for the same number of images but are all the images useable? If you are wondering, we consider a usable image to be the front of a car with the car’s logo clearly visible. If there are images that are not usable, please remove them from the set. 2. After dataset pruning, is the dataset big enough? Is there any imbalance in our dataset? 3. Is the dataset good quality? * Do many images require editing (cropping, zooming, sharpening, etc.)? * Are there other issues in our dataset you can see? * What are some challenges that you see with the current dataset? 4. Based on your evaluation, please lay out your plan for correcting any issues you’ve identified. * Do you plan on manually editing some images? * Can you do any standardization to the images? * Is there any data augmentation you can do? I expect you to send a link to the Colab Notebook with all the necessary code and text to answer the prompts above. For communication, you can use the messaging feature to reach out to both your project supervisors and my team if you have any questions. Thank you! Vaibhav Injection Card 2 Card Title (i.e., email subject): Dataset Improvement Hello, Thank you for your evaluation of our dataset! It was informative and helpful to help us better understand the needs of CV projects. I guess the second step in this project would naturally be for you to complete your proposed plan for improving our dataset. Please execute your plan and submit your new dataset. Also, just to help us better understand the process of dataset refinement, could you provide a brief explanation of the hiccups you encountered and how you overcame them while working on our dataset? I hope that your summary will help us identify potential issues/roadblocks for future projects. To summarize, I am expecting you to submit the link to your revised dataset and a link to the Colab Notebook with the following actions: * Apply the following image processing techniques to improve images in the dataset * Crop * Sharpen * Zoom * Apply data augmentation to the dataset to create ""new"" images and ensure the dataset is balanced * Provide a brief explanation of the hiccups you encountered and how you overcame them while working on our dataset Thank you, Vaibhav Injection Card 3 Card Title (i.e., email subject): Model Building Hello, Now that the data is ready, the next step must be building the model to recognize the car brand. Let me repeat that, we want to be able to identify the car brand, so feel free to process the images to isolate the car's logos. Please create as many models as you think necessary to get started, but we’d like you to submit a report explaining the three top-performing models. You can include as much information as you’d like, but as a minimum, we’d like to know the following: * The models’ names and a brief explanation of how each works. * Evaluation reports for each model. * Which model we should choose to deploy in production and why. * Consider evaluation metrics and the cost of running the model. I expect you to submit a Colab Notebook link with the text and code to address the above prompts. Regards, Vaibhav Injection Card 4 Card Title (i.e., email subject): Car Brand Identification Model Next Steps Hello, I’m happy to inform you that we are satisfied with the current status of the car brand identification model for the sake of the POC. Before we move on to the facial recognition aspect of the project, could you write us a report outlining what the next steps would be for this model? Specifically, we’d like your opinion on the following: * How can we continue to improve the accuracy of our model? * What camera would you recommend we purchase once we go live? * What is the best way to deploy this model? * Do we need to buy on-premises servers? Why? * Who is the best option for AI cloud services? What are the pros and cons of the top options? I expect you to submit a Google Documents link that addresses the above prompts. Thank you, Vaibhav Injection Card 5 Card Title (i.e., email subject): Facial Recognition Hello, It is time for us to move on to the second part of our project, facial recognition. We think this is a fundamental part of this project because collecting customer demographic data is fundamental for our targeted advertising. I have done some preliminary research and have seen various articles discussing premade facial recognition models. Can you advise us on the available open-source facial recognition options to see if they would be viable for our project? When you report your findings, please include your recommendation on the model we should use. I'd like you to submit a Colab Notebook link that contains both texts discussing the facial recognition models available as well as the code for demonstrating how we can use these models. Thank you Vaibhav  Injection Card 6 Card Title (i.e., email subject): Make the Facial Recognition Model Hello, We’ve reviewed your previous report and think we should proceed with your recommended model. Please create a sample dataset of photos of people in cars via web scraping and use the open-source model you’ve recommended to demonstrate its efficacy for our specific use case. You are expected to submit a link to the dataset in Google Drive and a link to your Colab Notebook. Thank you, Vaibhav Injection Card 7 Card Title (i.e., email subject): Facial Recognition – Ethics Hello, We recently had an internal meeting to discuss the project's status, and our human resources department raised an objection to the project. They are worried about potential personal privacy issues due to using a facial recognition model to collect customer demographics. We are unsure if this is common practice or not, what the specific laws are regarding collecting customer data with this method, or what we legally need to do to inform our customers about us using facial recognition onsite. Can you please write a report to address these three concerns and any other issues you think are relevant to this topic? Obviously, we need to be aware of any ethical considerations we need to make, and we want to comply with the law, so I cannot stress the importance of your diligence and thoroughness on this matter enough. Thank you, Vaibhav Injection Card 8 Card Title (i.e., email subject): Logo Identification and Facial Recognition Hello, We have gotten the green light to move ahead with the project as our legal department reviews your advice and comes up with a plan to ensure we are covered with this project. The next phase for us is that we need the model to be able to identify both the car logo and gather the customer demographic data. Can you combine the two models to do this? Thank you, Vaibhav "

END""} {""prompt"":""Hi, First of all thankyou for having me onboard and giving me this wonderful opportunity. Coming to the latest developments in the field of AI, though there have been many and continue to do so I really got interested when I first got to know about generative AI, an example of it for sure is none other than the chat gpt itself which really took the world by storm. Getting to know about the capabilities of generative AI is surely something which facinates me alot. The challenges being faced by organizations to implement AI generally include feeding the algorithms with the right kind of structured and unstructured data keeping in mind keeping in mind their is no infringement of the human right to privacy and also the amount of necessary data required is also a concern with new norms being created everyday. Another challenge could also be the complex and expensive processing resources needed are not that easily available for vast majority of businesses. Coming to my interest in artificial intelligence, I feel stems from my passion for problem-solving and curiosity about how machines can be programmed to mimic human intelligence. I have always been fascinated by the potential of AI to improve people's lives in various ways, from healthcare to environmental sustainability. In terms of my future career goals, I would like to continue to work in the AI field and contribute to its development and applications. Specifically, I am interested in exploring natural language processing and computer vision and their potential to revolutionize how we interact with technology. I also hope to work on AI projects that have a positive impact on society and address some of the world's most pressing issues. In terms of how data analysis and modelling skills could be applied to support AI consulting projects, data analysis and modeling are critical components of many AI projects. By analyzing data, we can identify patterns and trends that can inform AI models and improve their accuracy. Modeling allows us to develop AI algorithms that can make predictions, classify data, or identify anomalies. These skills can be applied to a wide range of projects, from developing chatbots that can interact with customers to creating predictive maintenance systems that can identify when equipment is likely to fail. Additionally, my natural language processing (NLP) capabilities could be leveraged to support AI consulting projects. I can help analyze and categorize large amounts of text data, extract important information, and identify patterns in human language. This could be useful in a variety of applications, such as sentiment analysis, customer feedback analysis, and topic modeling. Overall, data analysis and modeling, along with NLP, are essential skills for supporting AI consulting projects, as they provide the foundation for creating accurate and effective AI models.

I appreciate your suggestions for incorporating a strategy for deep-focus work. I agree that short work periods may not be ideal for coding projects that require an extended period of deep focus. I have researched the Pomodoro technique and the 20-20-20 rule, and while they have proven to be effective in improving productivity, I see your point that they may not be sufficient for long coding sessions. I provided a plan that I used on a daily basis. when I'm working on large projects or hackathons that demand long work time. I adjust my strategy accordingly, which enables me to sit through extended periods of coding. I typically use the 90-minute work block strategy to do this, scheduling 90-minute work blocks that are followed by 10-15 minute breaks to refuel. Once again, thank you for your feedback, and I appreciate it. ### "",""completion"":"" Happy to help. Regards, AI Minds Support. END""} {""prompt"":""Schedule outlining my perfect Work Day is as follows: 9:00-9:30AM:- I will login to the portal and see what all tasks I have in hand for the day. 9:30-9:50AM:- I will make a plan on how I wish to make full use of my peak productivity working hours and try to complete the biggest and the most complex task during that time. I will plan all the breaks as well as to when I want to take breaks and freshen my mind up. 9:50AM-2:00PM:- Will Work on the most complex bit of my tasks as these are the peak productivity hours of mine. will take a lunch break from 2:00PM-2:45PM 2:45-4:30PM:- Will complete the rest of the tasks given, try to look into the feedback from my supervisors and customers and try to make a note of them all. 4:30-5:00PM:- Will take a snack or a sports break when I can go and rejuvenate my mind and body. 5:00-6:00PM:- Try to finish up on all the tasks and wind up my work. I made a list of steps stating my strategies so that I can manage my time effectively: Setting clear goals: Starting by defining what I want to achieve and set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals. Writing down today's goals and making sure they are realistic and attainable. Prioritizing my tasks: This can be achieved by making a to-do list and prioritizing the tasks based on their importance and urgency. This helps to focus on the most critical tasks and avoid wasting time on less important activities. Creating a schedule: Using a planner or digital calendar to schedule tasks and activities. Allocating time slots for each task, and making sure I have enough time for breaks, relaxation, and other essential activities. Avoiding distractions: Identifying my biggest time-wasters and try to eliminate or minimize them. Taking breaks: It's essential to take regular breaks to recharge our batteries and stay productive. Taking short breaks every hour or so, and longer breaks every few hours helps quite much. Reviewing and adjustment: Regularly reviewing my schedule and adjusting it as needed. Being flexible and willing to adapt to changes in my circumstances or priorities. If I were to face obstacles or challenges, I would use the following strategies to overcome them. Firstly, I would identify the obstacle by being specific about what is standing in my way and try to understand why it's a problem. Then, I would brainstorm different solutions that could help me overcome it, evaluating each option based on its feasibility, effectiveness, and potential outcomes. Once I select the best solution, I would take action and implement it by breaking down the solution into small, manageable steps and working through each step systematically. If I encounter setbacks or challenges, I would persist and adapt, seeking help and support from others who may have expertise or resources that can help me overcome the obstacle. Finally, I would reflect on the experience and what I've learned, identifying what worked well and what didn't and using this knowledge to improve my problem-solving skills for future challenges. In summary, I believe that overcoming obstacles is an essential part of personal growth and development. By developing a positive attitude, staying focused on my goals, and using these strategies, I can overcome even the toughest obstacles and achieve my dreams.

I have done my schooling from New Horizon Public School, New Panvel, scoring 91.2% in 10th CBSE board. Further, I have studied in D.A.V Public School, New Panvel, scoring 94.2% in 12th CBSE Board. I believe in consistency and exploration. Consistency is the key to success. Small steps of work per day results in huge difference in the long run. I have always been consistent in my work, let it be college work, or self-study. It boosts my confidence and I aim high. I have always been that passionate student who has the zeal to explore wider range of options, gain knowledge from different fields, enhance skills in all possible ways. I am also hardworking and responsible. The quote that I ponder upon every time is “Enjoy the Process”. Everything takes time. It is the present we should live in and be grateful for the happenings in our life, whether it’s a moment of happiness or an obstacle, we learn from our mistakes. We truly enjoy what we do because there is no pressure to perform. We will ultimately achieve success over time. My hobbies are listening to music, painting, and travelling. I enjoy my own company too. I have worked on web development in my 1st year of college. I learnt HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP, and created a ‘Lost and Found’ website for my college. Further, I gained interest towards learning data analytics and machine learning. I have completed few courses from coursera and tried to do hands-on practice. I opted a research-based project for the minor project in 6th semester. The project title is ‘Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Product Reviews’. It is an application of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It uses deep learning model- LSTM, for predicting the accuracy of the reviews with respect to the ratings of the products from the customers extracted from the dataset. I have learnt the process of data cleaning, pre-processing, visualization etc. and the understanding of how the models work. I am also a selected candidate for the PwC ‘Analytics & Insights Launchpad Program’. It is a 4-month virtual industrial training program. This platform provides students with hands-on experience in data analytics and insights.

My most recent academic successes include being named to the dean's list for excellence in academics. I consider myself to be a moral person, and among the core values I inherited from my parents are gratitude for everything that occurs in my life and The second, and most crucial, is self-reflection and self-awareness. I prefer to take some time to think back on my actions and words and become aware of my strengths and weaknesses in order to improve as a person. I would describe myself as a bookworm; reading is something I like doing. The books Atomic Habits and The Compound Effect had a significant impact on me and helped me become a better person. One lesson I took away from both books is that making a small difference each day may have a big impact over time. I would also include my entire family. My parents are my greatest supporters and role models because they work so hard and are so positive. They have helped me become a better person. My interests include reading, cooking, and working out at the gym. I also enjoy plating badmentaion. I have worked on various datasets of data, the best project of mine in csv is student stress prediction where there were 50 columns and I used feature selection and chosen 5 attributes and got good accuracy, and on image dataset I worked on face shape detection and breast cancer prediction where I got 98.2 in face shape detection and 98.7 in breast cancer prediction. In terms of development, I enjoy flutter and enjoy playing with it. I created a messsing app and worked for Joel Farms, a business founded by a student at Manipal University in Jaipur, where I worked as a flutter developer. ### "",""completion"":"" Hello, Thank you for submitting your introduction.

Regards, AI Minds Support. END""} {""prompt"":""Should I build the update function for Bitcoin alone or make it for all three coins in Injection card 3? ### "",""completion"":"" Hello, In injection card 3 build the update function for Bitcoin and later in the injection card 5 you will have to build it for both Ethereum and Litecoin. Regards, AI Minds Support. END""} {""prompt"":""Can I deploy the model in any free deployment platforms other than Streamlit? ### "",""completion"":"" Hello, as per the requirements of the company we want the project to be deployed in Streamlit. But we would also like you to conduct a esearch on other free deployment platforms available for machine learning models and provide a report on your findings. Regards, AI Minds Support. END""} {""prompt"":""Which websites or data sources should we consider for obtaining cryptocurrency price data? ### "",""completion"":"" Hi, You can refer to the data source suggestions on the first injection card. These platforms offer APIs or direct data downloads for various cryptocurrencies.

END""} {""prompt"":""What should be included in the evaluation report for the multi-coin prediction model of Injection card 6? ### "",""completion"":"" Hi, Thank you for asking! I think the evaluation report can outline the training process for each model, including the input features, model architecture, etc. The report should also present the evaluation results for each model on the different test datasets, highlighting the metrics used and any observed trends or relationships as you see relevant for model efficiency and performance. Regards, AI Minds Support. END""} {""prompt"":""How do I get my bot to actually trade on an exchange? ### "",""completion"":"" Hi, if you wanted to actually use a bot to start trading on a live exchange you'd have to run the trading bot on a server (like your computer), set up an account with an exchange, and set up the bot to make trades through that account. However, all of that is out of the scope of this project because we are simply trying to show our users how bots can be used to predict prices and make trades, through code and theory, not on a live account. Regards, AI Minds Support. END""} {""prompt"":""Can we make a trading bot for other coins than Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin? ### "",""completion"":"" If you would like to create a trading bot for other coins using what you've learned during your work, please feel free to do so.

Regards, AI Minds Support. END""} {""prompt"":""What are the pros and cons of using APIs versus web scraping? ### "",""completion"":"" Hello, well, numerous factors need to be evaluated when deciding between web scraping and using an API for data collection. Web scraping has its advantages, such as flexibility to draw data from any site, broad data collection capabilities, no limits on data access, and cost-effectiveness. However, it does have its disadvantages, like potential legal issues if certain sites don't permit or restrict scraping, the technical difficulty of creating a scraper, and the intensive data cleaning that might be needed. On the other hand, APIs offer their own set of benefits, including efficiency, easy data access using credentials, and legal permission from the host site, with the data generally delivered in either XML or JSON format. The cons of using an API are limited data access, possibly cost money, the need to construct custom code containing access keys and data specifications, and the overhead introduced due to abstraction, which could result in slower performance. In essence, both web scraping and APIs have their respective pros and cons. The selection between the two depends largely on the specific use case and the website from which data needs to be extracted. APIs are often simpler to use and provide data in a structured form, but web scraping gives more flexibility and can be a more affordable solution for data extraction. For our purposes, I'd leave it to decide what is the best use for our project. Regards, AI Minds Support. END""} {""prompt"":""Can we rely on Yahoo Finance for cryptocurrency price data? ### "",""completion"":"" Hello, I have no reason to distrust Yahoo Finance. Do you have a reason to be suspicious? If you have noticed something or have discovered something, please notify us immediately. Regards, AI Minds Support. END""} {""prompt"":""How are features selected for inclusion or removal from the dataset? ### "",""completion"":"" Hello, the decision to keep or remove features within a dataset comes down to your judgment. Do you think features are relevant or not? If you retrain your model with or without specific features how well does it perform? Ultimately, we'd like to hear your opinion on the matter. If you do ever remove a feature, please explain why in a markdown cell or at least in a comment. Regards, AI Minds Support. END""} {""prompt"":""Can the data pipeline be automated for regular updates? ### "",""completion"":"" Hello, of course! For maintaining the data on your own system, automation is definitely encouraged however, for deploying this project on streamlit I will leave it to you to decide how best to automate the update of data or if updates should happen by a button when the app is in use. Regards, AI Minds Support. END""} {""prompt"":""Is it possible to extend the data pipeline to include other cryptocurrencies? ### "",""completion"":"" Hello, yes, it is certainly possible to include additional cryptocurrencies. However, if you are bringing in new currencies, as always, we'd like for you to account for those additional cryptocurrencies in the model and add any documentation necessary to keep us informed via comments or markdown cells. Regards, AI Minds Support. END""} {""prompt"":""How should the evaluation of the models be conducted? ### "",""completion"":"" Hello, as you are our AI expert we would expect you to add your recommendations on how best to evaluate models. I believe that AI models have specific evaluation metrics per scenario (i.e., different metrics for classification vs regression). Regards, AI Minds Support. END""} {""prompt"":""How should the performance of the models be compared? ### "",""completion"":"" Hello, well you have been (or should have been) evaluating the models you have been building thus far. Therefore to compare different models simply means to compare their evaluation metrics with each other. How to present them is another matter. Whether it be in a graph or a table, I will leave it to you to decide how best to present your comparison. Regards, AI Minds Support. END""} "

4,WebHelpers ProjectDetails,"WebHelpers ProjectDetails. WebHelpers - Project Details We’ve been recently contracted by a company that creates web extensions. They are called Web Helpers, focused on helping their users be as informed and avoid living in an echo chamber when surfing the internet. They are best known for their NewsReferee extension, which shares articles from politically opposed news agencies and fact-checker agencies that review all respective news sources. They are now working on a new e-commerce support extension that reads product webpages, extracts information, and provides insights to help customers make better purchasing decisions.The lead for this project is Dev, and they are mainly interested in how they can use NLP to process various information present within a product page efficiently. Since e-commerce websites vary in their content placement, Web Helpers wants to focus on Amazon for now, and then extend their product to other major e-commerce websites.This is where you come in. We have been asked to provide an AI expert to help them develop their e-commerce product support web extension.   The team is open to suggestions for improving their web extension and welcomes any ideas. However, they currently prioritize three key features for the first development phase: * Do text summarization to give the users a quick understanding of the product. * Sentiment analysis on the reviews of the product to give a high-level overview of the reviews that provide more information beyond the 1 - 5 star rating reviewers give. * Create a chatbot that answers questions about the product. The team has plans for a second development phase that integrates this work into their larger ecosystem. Injection Card 1 Card Title (i.e., email subject): Data Pipeline Hello, I am Dev, and very excited to start working with you. I believe your manager has given you the briefing for the project, so that I won’t waste any time on that. We think the first feature we’d like to develop is the sentiment analysis of customer reviews. Now we know that this is not a new AI application, and there are online datasets of customer reviews. But we are worried that if we only use a publicly available dataset, our model would not be that much better than other publicly available models. To address this, we’d like you to focus on is being able to process a webpage to collect customer reviews and product descriptions. The idea behind the product is that you can open up to any Amazon product. We will read, process, and extract essential information from the page (i.e., classify the reviews and summarize product information). Therefore, the first thing we have to do is be able to extract all that information from any Amazon product page. Please create a Jupyter notebook where I can upload an Amazon product URL, and it will process the page and return me one single dataset (csv file) that contains: Product Name, Category, Description, Reviews, Specification or Rating etc (5 columns is minimum).  You can use any libraries you’d like (like Beautiful Soup or Scrapy), but please justify the web scraping library you settle on in the comments. You don’t need to explain all libraries you use, only those used for web scraping, so we can understand how you approach web scraping. Also, there are many different types of products on Amazon, so to get started, you can collect an equal number of products from the categories: Gaming Accessories, Beauty Picks, Health & Personal Care, Electronics, Easy Returns, and Get Fit at Home. So let’s say 50 products per category and with six types will give us a minimum of 300 different products.  Injection Card 2 Card Title (i.e., email subject): Model Building - Sentiment Analysis Hello, Now that you’ve set up the data pipeline, the next step will be to train a model. We will first be focused on the sentiment analysis dashboard feature. As sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews is not a new application in AI, feel free to use a pre existing dataset or a merge of multiple datasets if you’d like. However, please justify your choice(s) of the dataset(s) for our project and verify that the dataset is indeed open-source. The last thing we need is for our dataset to be taken from a restricted source. Please create a comparative analysis of multiple models with as many models as necessary to get started. Still, we’d like you to submit a report explaining the three top-performing models. You can include as much information as you’d like, but as a minimum, we’d like to know the following: * The models’ names and a brief explanation of how each works. * Evaluation reports for each model: * Compare evaluation metrics * Computation time * Which model do you recommend for us to deploy in production eventually, and why?  Injection Card 3 Card Title (i.e., email subject): Dataset Expansion / Model Improvements- Sentiment Analysis Hello, We have also heard of data augmentation and synthetic data generation. Could you investigate how we could use both techniques to expand on the dataset we collected and then apply them to create an even more extensive dataset? In summary, please submit a jupyter notebook that does the following: Present various data augmentation and synthetic data generation techniques for text data and identity which methods you will use. Apply data augmentation/data generation Then merge the two datasets into a single file. Submit the final dataset and the notebook with clear and thorough comments / documentation. After creating a bigger dataset, we must return to the model building and evaluation. There's no need to explore multiple models like before. Still, I'd like you to return to the drawing board, train the top 3 models you identified earlier, and submit their new evaluation reports. Once all three models are trained, please identify the following: * The improvements per model pre and post-data augmentation * Which model do you recommend we finalize for sentiment analysis? * Was the other data creation/collection worth it in the end?  * i.e., should we aim to improve our dataset in this way continuously? If not, how can we further enhance our models' accuracy?  Injection Card 4 Card Title (i.e., email subject): Model Building - Text Summarization Hello, Thank you for submitting your final model. While we internally review the final sentiment analysis model, we’d like you to get started on the text summarization feature. Now with your dataset can you build a model to summarize these specific texts. I’m not very well versed in the AI resources available however, I do know that there are many big models that can be used for text summarization that are available in different open-source libraries. I’d recommend starting by using transfer learning / Use of Open Source libraries to train one of these big language models on our specific dataset. I’m expecting you to submit a jupyter notebook that will walk us through any data processing you deem necessary, model training, and model testing. I’m sure your manager has brought this up before but, I cannot stress the importance of properly documenting your code enough. We are a big team and once we take this forward to our other team, I do not want there to be any delay due to them trying to understand your code.  Injection Card 5 Card Title (i.e., email subject): Data Scraping – Ethics Hello, We recently had an internal meeting to discuss the project's status, and our human resources department raised an objection to the project. They are worried about potential ethical issues due to use of scraped product data from an e-commerce website owned by another company. We know that Amazon allows for collecting data to a point, but what about other companies? Generate a report to address the legal and ethical considerations of web scraping, such as the legality of the practice, laws and regulations surrounding data collection, and the requirements for informing e-commerce companies about the use of their data. Additional points to be considered : * The relevant licenses and terms and conditions of the e-commerce websites in question. * The laws and regulations surrounding data collection may vary depending on the country and the website's jurisdiction. * Data policies of the websites We are unsure if all e-commerce stores allow scraping or not, what the specific laws are regarding collecting product data with this method, or what we legally need to do to inform an e-commerce company about us using their data. Can you please write a report to address these three concerns and any other issues you think are relevant to this topic?  Injection Card 6 Card Title (i.e., email subject): Chatbot Hello, We have received approval to proceed with the project because Amazon permits data collection, and our legal team will review your suggestions and develop a plan to ensure we are covered for supporting other websites. Additionally, we have two updates to share. Firstly, we have also decided that the product summarization is not actually worth implementing because the product descriptions are already straight forward enough. Secondly, we have realized the importance of creating ar chatbot that can answer product-related questions after processing the current webpage. So i would like you to develop a chatbot that can assist customers with product-related inquiries for an amazon website. Consider using open source generative AI API to generate informative and engaging conversation prompts to keep users engaged. Injection Card 7 Card Title (i.e., email subject): Deployment - Streamlit Hello, Finally you have reached the last step of the project - Deployment. Deployment is an essential part of machine learning projects, deployment refers to the process of making a trained model available for use in a real-world setting.Deploying a machine learning model also allows for easy updates and maintenance, ensuring that the model remains up-to-date with the latest features and improvements. Develop a deployment in Streamlit that includes a machine learning model for sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews and a chatbot that can assist customers with product-related inquiries for an Amazon website. The chatbot should be able to handle various types of customer inquiries and provide helpful responses. "
